Title:          Eat Mobs For Power!

Description:    In this concept each vanilla minecraft mobs has small chance of dropping edible version of them and
                once consumed players will be transformed into them and gain their abilities. Mob transformation effects and abilities
                can last up to 60 seconds or by drinking milk. Eating new mob while under an effect will override the current effect.
